# Are we bio yet?
ðŸŽ‰ Yes! ðŸŽ‰

(but many projects are still work-in-progress)

The Rust bioinformatics ecosystem contains general, easy-to-use crates like [bio](https://crates.io/crates/bio), along with a plethora of crates for specific tasks.

## Ecosystem
Here you can find all sorts of bioinformatics crates that were created by the Rust community:

* [bio](https://crates.io/crates/bio) - Implementations of many useful bioinformatics data structures and algorithms, including pattern matching, alignment, suffix arrays, BWT, FM-Index, and parsers for common file types.
* [htsget-rs](https://github.com/umccr/htsget-rs) - GA4GH's [htsget](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/htsget.html) implementation.
* [rust-htslib](https://crates.io/crates/rust-htslib) - Provides HTSlib bindings and a high level Rust API for reading and writing BAM files.
* [needletail](https://crates.io/crates/needletail) - Fast FASTX parsing and k-mer methods in Rust.
* [noodles](https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles) - Bioinformatics I/O libraries in Rust
* [triple_accel](https://crates.io/crates/triple_accel) - Rust edit distance routines accelerated using SIMD. Supports fast Hamming, Levenshtein, restricted Damerau-Levenshtein, etc. distance calculations and string search.

## Contributing
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/arewebioyet/arewebioyet.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to contribute to this page. Feel free to list new bioinformatics crates! Of course, you can also contribute to the ecosystem by writing a new Rust crate.
